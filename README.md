# NadoCast.com â€” Intraday Tornado Prediction

Planning to use the [HREF](http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/HREF_doc.shtml), [SREF](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/SREF_doc.shtml), [HRRR](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/), and [Rapid Refresh](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/) weather models to generate hourly tornado probabilities.

If all goes well, the expected possible advantages over Storm Prediction Center's [Day 1 Outlook tornado probabilities](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html) are:

1. Finer temporal resolution: indicating _when_ during the day tornadoes are expected.
2. Hopefully more skill by using machine learning approaches.
